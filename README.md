# RockPaperScissors
Hello everyone! I'm excited to share my first ever project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although it is a very basic game of Rock Paper Scissors but it was great fun to make this project. Do drop suggestions if I can make any changes or add on something thrilling to make the game more fun.
